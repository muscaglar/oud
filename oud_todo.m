%% RC
%% Current, Voltage, PL plot to show minimal current
%% Analysis of 151117, 101117
%% Negative controls: Water, EL
%% Positive controls: Variation with concentration? Nano-diamonds?
%% Camera and laser refresh rate
%% RC Times etc.

    %   C1: 210nF +/- 1 n
    %   RC -> 0.00735s  -> fc = 21.2 Hz -> rise time 20 to 80% = 0.01029s,

%% Number of dots per area   and also the field. So we need electrode area and oncentration of dye/dots 
%% Legitimate to fit and rmeove bleaching 
%% Find the frequeny limit -> Perhaps 10Hz? Signal processing to decide through noise. 
%% Time it takes to form debye layer
%% Put forward a standard platform -> are we device limited or can we apply this cells? 
%% Include platelets
%% Device characteristics and response in the SI perhaps.
%% Find the fundamental limit and problem in the devices -> where to take the dyes and platform?
%% Future:
    %   Poly-electrolyte
    %   Single dot
            % with a huge shell (?)
    %   2D materials
